## Vision
Inspired by the game "The Division" & "Cyberpunk2077", I wanted to create a real world version of being in a futuristic society where everything is online, holograms are everywhere, and cybernetics are everywhere in the world. I essentially tried to create the currency for one of these worlds, with the ability to encrypt your Credits (the native currency) and transfer them to a HackerBot to begin hacking (the equivalent of staking).

I'm currently thinking about converting to an ERC1155 standard so that I could impliment NFTs (maybe bounties or special things to hack) which can be exchanged for Credits. Then I could eventaully turn it into a game with Engine or Unity.
